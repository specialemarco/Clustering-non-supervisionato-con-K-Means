# Unsupervised clustering with K-Means



Unsupervised learning is a fundamental branch of data analysis that focuses on discovering hidden structures in data without the presence of output labels.

Among the various unsupervised learning techniques, the K-means algorithm is one of the most widely used and popular for data clustering.

Let us take a detailed look at the operation and application of K-means, a partitional clustering algorithm that has proven to be effective in dividing data into homogeneous groups.

The goal of K-means is to assign each data point to the closest cluster relative to the centroid of that cluster, in order to minimise the total square error.
